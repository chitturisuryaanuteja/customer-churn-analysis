"## Overview" 
"" 
"This project aims to predict customer churn using various machine learning techniques. Churn prediction is crucial for businesses to retain customers by identifying those at risk of leaving." 
"" 
"## Dataset Description" 
"" 
"The dataset \`Train_data.csv\` contains customer information and the target variable indicating whether a customer has churned. The columns are:" 
"- \`Unnamed: 0\`: Index" 
"- \`RowNumber\`: Customer's row number" 
"- \`CustomerId\`: Customer ID" 
"- \`Surname\`: Customer surname" 
"- \`CreditScore\`: Credit score of the customer" 
"- \`Geography\`: Country of the customer" 
"- \`Gender\`: Gender of the customer" 
"- \`Age\`: Age of the customer" 
"- \`Tenure\`: Number of years the customer has been with the bank" 
"- \`Balance\`: Account balance of the customer" 
"- \`NumOfProducts\`: Number of bank products the customer is using" 
"- \`HasCrCard\`: Does the customer have a credit card? (1 = Yes, 0 = No)" 
"- \`IsActiveMember\`: Is the customer an active member? (1 = Yes, 0 = No)" 
"- \`EstimatedSalary\`: Estimated salary of the customer" 
"- \`Exited\`: Did the customer churn? (1 = Yes, 0 = No)" 
"- \`Complain\`: Did the customer complain? (1 = Yes, 0 = No)" 
"- \`Satisfaction_Score\`: Customer satisfaction score" 
"- \`Card_Type\`: Type of card the customer has" 
"- \`Point_Earned\`: Points earned by the customer" 
"- \`ReceivedPromotion\`: Did the customer receive a promotion? (1 = Yes, 0 = No)" 
"- \`AgeGroup\`: Age group of the customer" 
"- \`InterventionType\`: Type of intervention used for the customer"

"## Data Preprocessing" 
"" 
"The data preprocessing steps include:" 
"1. Replacing whitespace in column names with underscores." 
"2. Converting categorical features to dummy/indicator variables." 
"3. Dropping unnecessary columns." 
"4. Splitting the data into training and testing sets." 
"" 
"## Model Building and Training"

"### Models Used:" 
"- **Random Forest**" 
"- **Gradient Boosting (XGBoost)**" 
"- **LightGBM**" 
"### Hyperparameter Tuning:" 
"Grid Search with Cross-Validation was used to find the best hyperparameters."
